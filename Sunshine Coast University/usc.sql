In order to commence field experience placement within this program, students must undergo a Working with Children Check: As required by the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act (2000), pre-service teachers must undergo a criminal history check and be issued with a Suitability Card (Blue Card) by the Commission to allow them to undertake field experience in a school or centre in which children under 18 years of age are present.

While the flu vaccine is not yet mandatory for clinical sites, it is strongly recommended students also obtain this for the protection of themselves and vulnerable clients. Some sites may also require COVID 19 screening tests before starting placements, in addition to COVID 19 vaccination evidence. Students are also required to comply with infection control practices, safe manual handling, privacy and confidentiality principles and other relevant policies and procedures at each clinical site. Students also are advised that they need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend classes at Sunshine Coast Health Institute and so they should undertake this vaccination as soon as they accept their offer to study the Bachelor of Physiotherapy as classes may commence here as early as Semester 1 in Year 1. </span></p> <p><span>Students will also need to complete additional paperwork, tasks and training associated with work-integrated learning/clinical placements as they progress through the program. For example, mandatory tasks to be completed in relation to each clinical placement include: </span></p> <p><span>1. The UniSC Code of Conduct Form and uploading to SONIA before each placement <br/>2. Placement Agreement Forms and uploading to SONIA before each placement <br/>3. iLearn modules before Queensland Health placement (e.g. orientation checklist, building emergency procedures, prevention of musculoskeletal disorders, health safety and wellbeing, code of conduct and student deed poll) <br/>4. Clinical Experience Log and uploading to SONIA after each placement <br/>(The log includes a de-identified record of the clients students are involved in assessing and treating i.e. age, diagnosis, location, physio assessment and treatment skills -this is required for accreditation, and will inform placement allocations so that students meet practice threshold requirements ) </span></p> <p><span>Students are responsible for all costs associated with meeting “fit for placement” requirements and travel, accommodation, and parking associated with clinical placements. Where available, the placement office will advertise relevant scholarships and low-cost accommodation options for students on placements. Students will also need to purchase and wear their approved physiotherapy clinical uniform during clinical placements, as well as practical viva assessments and clinical simulations. The navy ‘Physiotherapy Student’ embroidered short sleeve ladies'''' blouse, men’s shirt or unisex tunic must always be worn whilst on placement. Shirts, blouses, and tunics can be ordered online from Game Clothing and will be shipped directly to students. Orders may take up to four weeks to arrive. </span></p> <p><span>Note Additional USC Uniform requirements: </span></p> <p><span>- Navy or black tailored trousers or shorts (knee-length) <br/>- Navy, charcoal or black closed-in shoes <br/></span><span>- USC Student cards must always be worn and visible whilst on placement <br/>- A plain, dark coloured jacket, jumper or cardigan may be added in cool weather <br/>- Jewellery, make-up and scent (e.g. perfume, deodorant, aftershave) is to be kept to a minimum. <br/>- Hair, whatever the style, should be professional looking and tidy. <br/>- Fingernails kept short, clean, and free of nail polish.
