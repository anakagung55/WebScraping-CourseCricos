As old as humanity itself, music is the soundtrack to our lives.</div><p>From your first year of study, you will take part in a vibrant concert and events program and explore diverse musical styles and genres through performance and creation. Use your elective zone to skill up in another area, consider a double degree to broaden your career possibilities, or go on an overseas exchange program to extend your global outlook. The possibilities are huge.</p><p>Studying music from our island campus of Tasmania teaches you to embrace diversity, connections and ingenuity, leading to a rewarding future in music. <strong>Your degree is built around a Music Practice major, in which you develop your individual skills in a specialisation of your choice:</strong></p><ul><li>Classical Performance</li><li>Composition</li><li>Film Scoring and Music for Media</li><li>Jazz and Popular Music Performance</li><li>Music Technology</li><li>Songwriter</li></ul><p>You also have the unique option to combine two specialisations, or two different instruments within a single specialisation, with the Dual Practice major.</p><p>Tasmania provides a unique backdrop for exploring both current and historical cultural contexts of music. Discover how place, spectacle, politics and the future borrow from and influence music, letting your interests drive the creation of new works and projects. To help you realise ideas and prepare you for the ever-changing musical landscape, you will pick up essential skills in recording, digital production, arranging, project management and an awareness of the music industry.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Go boldly into your creative future at The Hedberg</p><p>It all happens from The Hedberg - <a href="https://www.utas.edu.au/the-hedberg">the new home of music here in Hobart</a>. Leverage the building’s ground-breaking technical capability and generous studio spaces to improve the scale and complexity of your work. Sit in on a professional multi-room recording session, discover how variable acoustics are used as a compositional tool, or explore the production workflow of a visiting producer in a masterclass.</p><p>From year one, you will take part in a vibrant public concert program across the Hedberg’s incredible venues and spaces — and outside in Tasmania’s thriving arts scene.</p><p>Through access to exclusive creative collaborations with Fine Arts, Media, and Theatre and Performance students you will build close creative networks, test working relationships, and leverage your accomplishments to generate future opportunities. Find yourself working with Tasmania’s left-field festivals, creating scores for diverse creative projects, or soaking up inspiration together on a field trip overseas.</p><p>This degree can be combined to form a double degree.

Effective conservation and management of this significant land estate is central to achieving global conservation and sustainable development goals. Conservation professionals need to be trained in aspects of governance, planning and management in order to ensure the protected area estate effectively conserves nature and natures benefits to people.</div><p>This course will provide you with the knowledge and skills required by contemporary protected area conservation professionals working in middle or senior governance or management roles. This course covers governance, planning and management practice in government, private and community-based protected areas, as well as broader landscape contexts. Terrestrial, freshwater and marine protected areas are addressed. You will apply skills in governance, planning, and management to address complex conservation problems across landscapes and within protected areas.</p><p>The course has been designed to meet international competencies for protected area planners specified by the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas, with a particular focus on middle and senior governance and management roles. The structure of the degree ensures that graduates have the full range of required skills for protected area planners and managers in senior roles. Experiential learning is facilitated through field components within the core units, which involve practical experience of working world activities in natural environments. Students are offered further opportunity to customize their learning through an elective facilitating exploration of conservation topics in Tasmania as well as a capstone professional placement unit in the final year of study.</p><p>Tasmania is the ideal place to undertake a degree focused on protected area governance and management. Within half an hour from the Sandy Bay campus, we access marine, coastal, heathland, wetland, grassland, woodland, dry eucalypt, wet eucalypt, rainforest, subalpine and alpine natural environments, as well as urban nature. The Tasmanian world heritage recognised wilderness is little over an hour’s drive away. Tasmanian nature is so distinctive and important that half the State is in reserves and approximately half the area of these reserves is world heritage.

This includes the promotion of meaningful participation in decision-making and the equitable distribution of environmental benefits and risks. We focus on planning for the diverse communities and future generations to flourish. This one-year course is the foundation of planning theory and statutory planning with an environment and justice emphasis.</p><p>Tasmania provides a special learning environment for planners. Urban areas, agricultural landscapes, extensive tracts of natural lands, and internationally significant cultural heritage provide rich case studies. Low student-to-teacher ratios maximise opportunities for academic interaction and support, and staff have close ties with the planning profession.</p><p>If you already have a Bachelor''s degree and want to expand your skill set, the Graduate Diploma delivers foundational knowledge and skills that apply across various sectors. Professionals such as engineers, nurses, teachers, and ICT experts have successfully transitioned into different planning roles by enhancing their expertise with this course.</p><p>The Graduate Diploma can be extended into a Master of Planning. The two-year Master’s course includes a professional placement unit and offers opportunities for more specialised learning, focusing on issues such as climate change and urban greening. Units from the Graduate Diploma are credited towards the Master’s, allowing the Master of Planning to be completed in one year (full-time).</p><p>Planning at the University of Tasmania focuses on contemporary issues and real-world professional development. We advocate for equitable urban and regional planning while making the most of the wonderful field experiences available in Tasmania. The City of Hobart boasts a diverse urban landscape, rich cultural heritage, natural reserves, and unique ecosystems that are easily accessible. We take advantage of this diversity by offering electives in environmental planning, protected area planning, sustainability, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).</p><p><strong>Ready to explore your study options?</strong></p><p>Start by watching our video on<a href="https://echo360.net.au/media/c76e7008-ed65-4425-9d19-d31f0110cb24/public"> what units you will study</a> to gain an overview of the course structure.</p><p>Then, book an online one-on-one appointment with our course coordinator to explore your study options further and discuss how the Graduate Diploma of Environmental Planning aligns with your career goals.<br/> <br/><a href="https://outlook.office365.com/book/MasterofPlanningcourseadvice@UniversityTasmania.onmicrosoft.com/" title="Book Now">Book Now</a></p> </div>',
