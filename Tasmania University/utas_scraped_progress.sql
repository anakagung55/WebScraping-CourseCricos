Online students can also study in their own time.</p><p>However, the Bachelor of Natural Environments Conservation does have three units that have compulsory face-to-face activities. This means you’ll need to come to Tasmania to complete these units (normally, over a short-period of time, up to 10-days). These units are KGA213 which is studied at the end of first year, KGA331 which is studied at the end of second year and KGA318 which is studied at the end of third year. Students may also attend the optional camp or mandatory equivalent online activities in KGA327.
