And, with the rise of so many new industries in Australia, accountants have never been in higher demand. Studying your degree with Notre Dame will give you an extra edge, especially as the CPA fully accredits our degree Australia and Chartered Accountants in Australia and New Zealand.</p><p style="text-align: left;">As part of your degree, you must undertake 150 hours of practical experience in a workplace of your choice. This is not work experience but an embedded internship – indeed, many of our students later find full-time employment with the company where they took their practicum. According to the current QILT (Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching) survey of Australian academic institutions, 76.7 per cent of our graduates found full-time employment after completing their business program at Notre Dame – more than 3 percent above the national average.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The School of Business has built strong links with the business community, which provides obvious benefits for our students. The Commonwealth Bank, Century 21, Nine Network, Bauer Media and St George Bank are just some companies participating in our internship roster. Apart from a dynamic internship program, the university attracts some of the state’s high achievers to teach and inspire our students.</p><p style="text-align: left;">A degree in accounting offers a wide variety of career paths. Depending on your interests and choice of courses, you could specialise in internal auditing, forensic accounting or tax accounting.</p> </div>',

It is a well-rounded undergraduate program that combines theory, the latest teaching technology, and plenty of hands-on classroom experience. Working from a rigorous and practical curriculum, you will acquire the academic skills to teach secondary school students.</p><p>In addition, you will be required to choose one major teaching area such as English, Humanities and Social Sciences, Mathematics, Science or Religious Education. You will complete eight courses in your chosen major area, plus four courses in your chosen area of specialisation.</p><p>As part of the Bachelor of Science component of the double degree, you will study core interdisciplinary Science courses, including experimental design, maths, biology, and chemistry. These courses provide the basis for strong skills in scientific investigation, including data collection and analysis, critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and effective communication. These skills are highly sought after by employers within and outside the field of science.</p><p>Building on these core Science courses, you will deepen your study of science by selecting a Science Stream that matches your interests: Biology &amp; Environment, Environment &amp; Heritage, Human &amp; Medical Science, or Multidisciplinary Science. Each Stream ensures in-depth knowledge and skill development through practical hands-on experience in the classroom, the laboratory, and the field. This will prepare you well to inspire your students and teach Science within an educational setting.</p><p>The 32 weeks of supervised teaching (practicum) experience is integral to your degree. This is divided into two weeks of classroom immersion and teacher assistance in your first year; one term with a particular focus on your Learning Area Major in both your second and third years; one term with a special emphasis on your Learning Area Specialisation in your third year; and an internship in your final year which focuses on both your Learning Area Major and Specialisation, as well as Religious Education if you have chosen to complete your accreditation to teach Religious Education.</p><p>Our degree will provide the academic skills needed to support, engage, and extend secondary school children in science by integrating theory and practice. Get in contact with us today to enrol. Please note: Education students in WA must sit the national Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students (LANTITE). The test is administered externally by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER). You must register and pay for the test.</p> </div>',

    course_description = '<div class="accordion__content" id="Why_study_this_degree-1" style="--panel-height: 491px;"> <p>Are you considering studying for a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in conjunction with the Bachelor of Laws degree? The University of Notre Dame Australia is among the only universities in Australia which offers this double degree. Students taking this degree combination will develop the ability to consider issues using two of the most advanced forms of thinking and analysis in Western civilisation: law and philosophy. This combination equips students with an array of skills they can draw upon to resolve problems for themselves and their clients.</p><p>The Bachelor of Laws degree is accredited for admission to legal practice. It combines excellent coverage of underlying legal and ethical principles with an explanation of how they are applied in legal practice.</p><p>However, as a student of the School of Philosophy, you will encounter the works of great minds such as Aquinas, Socrates and Plato. In doing so, you will be encouraged to reflect deeply and critically on the fundamental questions of existence, as well as question your preconceptions of ethics and morality. As a result, graduates from the School of Philosophy can analyse and evaluate arguments about our current political, religious, and ethical systems – all valuable skills for a lawyer.</p><p>Similarly, the training you receive in the legal component of your degree will further develop your analytical mindset. Considered to be a degree of methodology rather than one solely of content, a Bachelor of Laws from Notre Dame teaches students to consider new approaches to problem-solving and analysis. By participating in lively debate and the free exchange of ideas in intimate class settings, you will develop mastery of public speaking, advocacy, research, and dispute resolution.</p> </div>',

Many lawyers pursue political careers, but studying the law also equips you to become a policy adviser in state or Federal Government. In addition, our Bachelor of Laws degree is an accredited degree for admission to legal practice. It covers underlying legal and ethical principles and explains how they are applied in legal practice.</p><p>Being part of the School of Law is an enriching and enjoyable experience. As a student, you will be in a small class (for the last few years, our average class size has been 31 students) and have access to academics outside of class. Inspired by the caring Catholic ethos which runs through the School of Law, academics are committed to quality teaching and providing excellent pastoral care to each student. The University aims to give students every opportunity to fulfil their potential as a student and be inspired to go out into the community and make a difference.</p><p>The Notre Dame Law degree has a particular focus on the basic building blocks of the law (the so-called “Priestley” subjects) and on developing practical skills such as public speaking, advocacy, alternative dispute resolution and commercial practice skills. Through our mentoring and internship programs, students have many opportunities to experience the law in practice. All your lecturers have substantial experience in legal practice (either as solicitors, Canon law or environmental law experts, barristers or judges). This allows each student to learn the Principles of law and how they apply in legal practice.</p> </div>',

With majors in Archaeology, Biology, Environmental Science and Human Biology you will also have the opportunity of completing a Double Major in another discipline such as Journalism, Film &amp; Screen Production, Philosophy, Business Studies or Politics &amp; International Relations.</p> <p>Whatever combination you choose, eight out of your 24 courses must be allocated to your Science Major. You will be required to study three Core Curriculum courses and one foundation Communication course, plus two Science foundation courses (Introduction to Biological Sciences and Introduction to Physical Sciences) before moving onto your three compulsory Science courses (Data Analysis and Experimental Design, and Directed Science Research and Science Internship). The Directed Science Research project in your final year of study is an opportunity for you to specialise in a particular area of interest and to develop additional fieldwork and problem-solving skills.</p>--><p>If you want to make a career in the field of science, this degree is a perfect choice. You will study core interdisciplinary Science courses, including experimental design, maths, biology, chemistry, and ecology. These courses provide the basis for strong skills in scientific investigation, including data collection and analysis, critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and effective communication and ensure versatile graduates. These skills are highly sought after by employers and applicable to many workplaces both within and outside the field of Science.</p><p>Building on these core Science courses, you will deepen your study of Science by selecting a Science Stream that matches your interests: Biology &amp; Environment, Environment &amp; Heritage, Human &amp; Medical Science, or Multidisciplinary Science.
