And, with the rise of so many new industries in Australia, accountants have never been in higher demand. Studying your degree with Notre Dame will give you an extra edge, especially as the CPA fully accredits our degree Australia and Chartered Accountants in Australia and New Zealand.</p><p style="text-align: left;">As part of your degree, you must undertake 150 hours of practical experience in a workplace of your choice. This is not work experience but an embedded internship – indeed, many of our students later find full-time employment with the company where they took their practicum. According to the current QILT (Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching) survey of Australian academic institutions, 76.7 per cent of our graduates found full-time employment after completing their business program at Notre Dame – more than 3 percent above the national average.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The School of Business has built strong links with the business community, which provides obvious benefits for our students. The Commonwealth Bank, Century 21, Nine Network, Bauer Media and St George Bank are just some companies participating in our internship roster. Apart from a dynamic internship program, the university attracts some of the state’s high achievers to teach and inspire our students.</p><p style="text-align: left;">A degree in accounting offers a wide variety of career paths. Depending on your interests and choice of courses, you could specialise in internal auditing, forensic accounting or tax accounting.</p> </div>',

You’ll research historic and contemporary architecture, make precise drawings and diagrams, and use physical and three-dimensional digital models while developing your creative and critical thinking.</p><p>Our program combines theory classes with practical studios. In the theory classes, you will analyse the world we live in. You’ll apply this knowledge and skills in studios as you design built environments and speculate about future possibilities for human occupation and ecological repair.</p><p>You will develop your sense of ethical, social and environmental responsibility as you learn to understand diverse cultures and contexts and apply building technology and environmental science knowledge to solve increasingly complex design scenarios.</p><p>Our holistic approach to education, including classes in ethics and philosophy, and the opportunity to study a Minor in a discipline complementary to architecture, will extend your learning beyond the traditional architectural curriculum and prepare you for a dynamic professional life. Popular Minors that work well with Architecture are Archaeology, History, Environmental Management and Photography.</p><p>See the complete list of Minors under the Program summary below. The freedom to choose a Minor from a complementary discipline allows you to follow your personal or professional interests and increases your graduate employability opportunities.</p><p>Through this program, you will be well placed to make a life-long contribution to communities'' intellectual, cultural and civic life.</p><p>The Bachelor of Arts (Architecture) program can be a pathway to further study in the Master of Architecture program and provides a solid foundation to develop the technical and communication skills, professional values and ethical practice required by architecture.</p> </div>',

At The University of Notre Dame Australia, we have brought this concept of a broadly based classical arts degree into the 21st Century.</p><p>Our Liberal Arts Major brings together subjects as diverse as Latin, Cosmology, Mathematics, Psychology and Creative Writing, allowing you to follow several academic interests during your undergraduate years rather than pick one stream.</p><p>By covering such a broad range of subjects, you will be able to develop a high level of critical thinking and an appreciation of quite distinct academic disciplines. Liberal Arts can be studied as a single major or combined with another stream of study, such as Journalism, Politics &amp; International Relations, Social Justice or Sociology, as part of a double major.

Specifically, graduates may work with diverse populations including individuals living with chronic disease such as cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, mental illness, disability and long-term sporting injuries. Acquiring in-depth knowledge and skills in core and emerging areas in the field, students will be equipped to practice in dynamic health environments within urban or rural settings.</p><p>The Bachelor of Clinical Exercise Physiology is currently seeking full accreditation status with the professional registration body - Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA). Following successful full accreditation, graduates will be eligible to ascertain registration as an AEP. Exercise Physiology services are now officially recognised under Medicare as an allied health service. Patients referred to AEPs by their GP, for whom exercise is important for treatment of chronic health problems, are eligible to claim a Medicare rebate. AEP’s are also eligible to register with the Department of Veterans Affairs, National Disability Insurance Scheme, WorkCover, and numerous private allied health providers.</p><p>Studying the Bachelor of Clinical Exercise Physiology at UNDA also provides opportunities for unique and contemporary practicum opportunities such as within rural and remote health that reflect the expansion of evidence-based practice in the field of Clinical Exercise Physiology.</p> </div>',

    course_description = '<div class="accordion__content" id="Why_study_this_degree-1" style="--panel-height: 491px;"> <p>Are you considering studying for a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in conjunction with the Bachelor of Laws degree? The University of Notre Dame Australia is among the only universities in Australia which offers this double degree. Students taking this degree combination will develop the ability to consider issues using two of the most advanced forms of thinking and analysis in Western civilisation: law and philosophy. This combination equips students with an array of skills they can draw upon to resolve problems for themselves and their clients.</p><p>The Bachelor of Laws degree is accredited for admission to legal practice. It combines excellent coverage of underlying legal and ethical principles with an explanation of how they are applied in legal practice.</p><p>However, as a student of the School of Philosophy, you will encounter the works of great minds such as Aquinas, Socrates and Plato. In doing so, you will be encouraged to reflect deeply and critically on the fundamental questions of existence, as well as question your preconceptions of ethics and morality. As a result, graduates from the School of Philosophy can analyse and evaluate arguments about our current political, religious, and ethical systems – all valuable skills for a lawyer.</p><p>Similarly, the training you receive in the legal component of your degree will further develop your analytical mindset. Considered to be a degree of methodology rather than one solely of content, a Bachelor of Laws from Notre Dame teaches students to consider new approaches to problem-solving and analysis. By participating in lively debate and the free exchange of ideas in intimate class settings, you will develop mastery of public speaking, advocacy, research, and dispute resolution.</p> </div>',

Many lawyers pursue political careers, but studying the law also equips you to become a policy adviser in state or Federal Government. In addition, our Bachelor of Laws degree is an accredited degree for admission to legal practice. It covers underlying legal and ethical principles and explains how they are applied in legal practice.</p><p>Being part of the School of Law is an enriching and enjoyable experience. As a student, you will be in a small class (for the last few years, our average class size has been 31 students) and have access to academics outside of class. Inspired by the caring Catholic ethos which runs through the School of Law, academics are committed to quality teaching and providing excellent pastoral care to each student. The University aims to give students every opportunity to fulfil their potential as a student and be inspired to go out into the community and make a difference.</p><p>The Notre Dame Law degree has a particular focus on the basic building blocks of the law (the so-called “Priestley” subjects) and on developing practical skills such as public speaking, advocacy, alternative dispute resolution and commercial practice skills. Through our mentoring and internship programs, students have many opportunities to experience the law in practice. All your lecturers have substantial experience in legal practice (either as solicitors, Canon law or environmental law experts, barristers or judges). This allows each student to learn the Principles of law and how they apply in legal practice.</p> </div>',

With majors in Archaeology, Biology, Environmental Science and Human Biology you will also have the opportunity of completing a Double Major in another discipline such as Journalism, Film &amp; Screen Production, Philosophy, Business Studies or Politics &amp; International Relations.</p> <p>Whatever combination you choose, eight out of your 24 courses must be allocated to your Science Major. You will be required to study three Core Curriculum courses and one foundation Communication course, plus two Science foundation courses (Introduction to Biological Sciences and Introduction to Physical Sciences) before moving onto your three compulsory Science courses (Data Analysis and Experimental Design, and Directed Science Research and Science Internship). The Directed Science Research project in your final year of study is an opportunity for you to specialise in a particular area of interest and to develop additional fieldwork and problem-solving skills.</p>--><p>If you want to make a career in the field of science, this degree is a perfect choice. You will study core interdisciplinary Science courses, including experimental design, maths, biology, chemistry, and ecology. These courses provide the basis for strong skills in scientific investigation, including data collection and analysis, critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and effective communication and ensure versatile graduates. These skills are highly sought after by employers and applicable to many workplaces both within and outside the field of Science.</p><p>Building on these core Science courses, you will deepen your study of Science by selecting a Science Stream that matches your interests: Biology &amp; Environment, Environment &amp; Heritage, Human &amp; Medical Science, or Multidisciplinary Science. Each Stream ensures in-depth knowledge and skill development through practical hands-on experience in the classroom, the laboratory, and the field.</p><p><strong>Science Streams</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.notredame.edu.au/about-us/faculties-and-schools/school-of-arts-and-sciences/fremantle/course-descriptions/biology-and-environment-stream">Biology &amp; Environment</a></li><li><a href="https://www.notredame.edu.au/about-us/faculties-and-schools/school-of-arts-and-sciences/fremantle/course-descriptions/environment-and-heritage-stream">Environment &amp; Heritage</a></li><li><a href="https://www.notredame.edu.au/about-us/faculties-and-schools/school-of-arts-and-sciences/fremantle/course-descriptions/human-and-medical-science-stream">Human &amp; Medical Science</a></li><li><a href="https://www.notredame.edu.au/about-us/faculties-and-schools/school-of-arts-and-sciences/fremantle/course-descriptions/multidisciplinary-science">Multidisciplinary Science</a></li></ul><p><strong>Majors</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.notredame.edu.au/programs/arts-and-sciences/undergraduate/bachelor-of-science-major-archaeology">Archaeology</a></li><li><a href="https://www.notredame.edu.au/programs/arts-and-sciences/undergraduate/bachelor-of-science-major-biology">Biology</a></li><li><a href="https://www.notredame.edu.au/programs/arts-and-sciences/undergraduate/bachelor-of-science-major-environmental-management">Environmental Management</a></li></ul><p><strong>Minors</strong></p><p>You may incorporate greater breadth of perspective and experience by studying courses from one or more areas of secondary interest, such as Journalism, Screen Arts (formerly, Politics and International Relations, Social Justice, Business Studies or Behavioural Science.</p> </div>',
