The technically oriented student can major in Software Development; whereas the more conceptually oriented student can major in Information Systems.</p><p> </p><p>All of the majors are founded on an introduction to the principles of programming, a broad perspective on the computing discipline and profession, and an introduction to the functional structure of computers. They also require a grounding in mathematics and theoretical computer science, which is a means of developing the ability to work with abstractions, a fundamental requirement for understanding and applying ideas in computing.</p><p><br/></p><p>You will get a strong grounding in computing fundamentals to tackle the progressive nature of Computing.

It provides students with the empirical knowledge and analytical skills to understand the history and causes of international conflict and the implications of security issues for Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. Students will develop the experience and communication skills to assess the nature of contemporary security problems, and drawing on the latest academic scholarship, engage with policy and civil society solutions to the security problems of our time. </p><p><br/></p><p>The BINSS is particularly suited for those seeking careers in the Australian Government, such as working as a diplomat in Foreign Affairs and Trade, as a strategist in the Department of Defence, or as a security analyst in the Intelligence Community. Graduates will also be well placed to contribute to international organisations such as the United Nations, to Aid and Development groups, or to support the private sector as businesses and non-government organisations navigate a challenging world.</p></div>',

    course_description = '<div class="introduction" id="introduction"><p>Statistics opens the door to understanding our world by exploring data and modelling uncertainty. As our capacity to collect data accelerates, the need for statistical expertise has never been greater. Every day, over 328.77 million terabytes of data are generated globally, and the total volume of data worldwide is expected to reach 181 zettabytes by 2026, more than doubling from 2022 levels. This explosion of information outpaces our ability to interpret it meaningfully without advanced quantitative tools.</p><p>More than a decade ago, Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google, famously predicted that “the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians.” That foresight has proved correct—and remains relevant today. In a data-driven world, statistics is indispensable across every discipline that grapples with uncertainty and complexity, from climate science and public health to economics, artificial intelligence, and national security.</p><p>Statisticians are in high demand across diverse sectors, including global tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon, financial institutions, government agencies, pharmaceutical firms, healthcare providers, and academic institutions. Moreover, statisticians are at the forefront of addressing critical challenges such as climate change, pandemic preparedness, cybersecurity, and economic inequality.</p><p>By completing the Bachelor of Statistics at ANU, you’ll gain the analytical skills and modelling expertise to make sense of an increasingly complex world. You will be equipped to extract insights from data, make informed decisions, and help solve some of humanity’s most urgent problems—through the lens of statistical reasoning and data science.</p></div>',

The Master of Anthropology and Planetary Futures engages critical social thought and research methods to step back from crisis-thinking to consider the political and social work that these threats justify and enable, and provides evidence bases for advocacy and public debate. The degree equips students to describe and theorise how planetary emergencies came about precisely due to human social engineering and the dominance of particular sets of cultural values, while also recognising that they are shaped by the creative responses of people responding to rapid transformations on their own terms.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Why study Anthropology at the ANU?</strong></p><p>The Master of Anthropology and Planetary Futures emphasises rigour in research methodologies to develop key analytical skills for systems thinking alongside cutting edge qualitative, fieldwork-based, and applied skills that provide solid empirical and critical foundations for future research careers. Training in methods from biological anthropology is combined with cultural anthropology’s ethnographic exploration of human diversity.

    course_description = '<div class="introduction" id="introduction"><p>The Master of Contemporary Practices in Art (Advanced) is aimed at artists who want to develop a more ambitious, independent contemporary art practice. The program extends a student’s practical, theoretical and conceptual knowledge in order to develop a deeper understanding of contemporary practices in context of how artists work in a range of disciplines. Contemporary artists respond to the challenges and questions that arise in an increasingly global and technologically advanced world. Their approaches are diverse, combining materials, methods and subjects that extend their practice. Artists today increasingly problem solve, collaborate with a variety of partners, and think and work outside of the traditional boundaries that distinguish a contemporary practice. This graduate program is unique as it supports hands on learning development in workshop, studio and digital environments by progressing students through courses that support individual practice-led research opportunities. Students are encouraged to undertake a range of approaches to contemporary art practice, including a focus on specialist knowledge of materials and skills, testing new conceptual methodologies, and/or solving problems through cross-disciplinary or hybrid experiences. Students benefit directly from and contribute to the research environment found within the School of Art and Design.</p></div>',

Admission to most ANU programs is on a competitive basis. Therefore, meeting all admission requirements does not automatically guarantee entry. In line with the University''s admissions policy and strategic plan, an assessment for admission may include competitively ranking applicants on the basis of specific academic achievement, English language proficiency and diversity factors. Applicants will first be ranked on a GPA (''GPA1'') that is calculated using all but the last semester (or equivalent) of the Bachelor degree used for admission purposes. If required, ranking may further be confirmed on the basis of:</p><ul><li>a GPA (''GPA2'') calculated on the penultimate and antepenultimate semesters (or equivalent) of the Bachelor degree used for admission purposes; and/or</li><li>demonstrating higher-level English language proficiency</li></ul><p>Prior to enrolment in this ANU program, all students who gain entry will have their Bachelor degree reassessed, to confirm minimum requirements were met.</p><p>Further information: <a href="https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_6546951" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">English language admission requirements and post-admission support</a></p><p><strong>Diversity factors: </strong>As Australia’s national university, ANU is global representative of Australian research and education. ANU endeavours to recruit and maintain a diverse and deliberate student cohort representative not only of Australia, but the world. In order to achieve these outcomes, competitive ranking of applicants may be adjusted to ensure access to ANU is a reality for brilliant students from countries across the globe.</p><p><strong>Assessment of qualifications: </strong>Unless otherwise indicated, ANU will accept all Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications or international equivalents that meet or exceed the published admission requirements of our programs, provided all other admission requirements are also met.</p><p>Where an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will base assessment on the qualification that best meets the admission requirements for the program.

ANU will base assessment on the best GPA of all completed tertiary qualifications of the same level or higher.</p><p>ANU uses a 7-point Grade Point Average (GPA) scale. All qualifications submitted for admission at ANU will be converted to this common scale, which will determine if an applicant meets our published admission requirements.
