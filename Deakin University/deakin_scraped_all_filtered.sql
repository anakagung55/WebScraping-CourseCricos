Graduate with an eye-catching portfolio and build transferable skills that prepare you to be flexible across the creative jobs of the future.<br/><br/><strong>Want to push your creative practice to new heights?</strong></p><div style="display: none; transition: max-height 0.8s, opacity 0.8s; overflow: hidden; max-height: 0px; opacity: 0;"> <p>The Master of Creative Arts allows you to focus your studies on one of six creative areas: dance, drama, new media, photography, visual arts, or visual communication design. But that doesn’t mean your knowledge will be limited to your specialisation. Throughout the course, you will be studying complementary disciplines and practising alongside creative thinkers from different backgrounds, broadening your understanding of creativity and arming you with transferable skills that prepare you for any creative pursuit.</p> <p>The multidisciplinary aspect of the course could see you specialising in dance while taking an elective unit in film writing, ultimately leading to the production of a dance film for your final creative project.</p> <p>While core study areas will be tailored to your specialisation, there are common threads throughout each pathway that set you up to be a versatile creative practitioner. Build transferable skills that employers value, like imaginative thinking, problem solving and creative collaboration, and discover what it takes to be adaptable and resourceful – two key attributes of the modern creative.</p> <p>Strengthen your creative repertoire with elective units. Your electives can play to your strengths, or help you upskill in an unfamiliar discipline. Some of your elective options include:</p> <ul> <li>Writing with the Camera</li> <li>Documentary Production Practice</li> <li>Art Marketing</li> <li>Introduction to Digital Photography</li> <li>Design Thinking and Problem Solving</li> </ul> <p>The course provides lots of practical experience, including sought-after internship opportunities, allowing you to hone your creative craft in real-world settings. You’ll work on industry-relevant creative projects, applying theoretical frameworks in teams and as an individual. And you will complete a major creative work in professional standard facilities, including TV broadcast studios, dance and drama studios, a professional photographic light studio, visual arts and design studios and dedicated gallery spaces. On top of that, your creative research projects will train you in practical research skills that benefit your everyday life, as well as your career.</p> <p>While many of our graduates go on to secure exciting roles in creative industries, there are also opportunities for further study upon successful completion of the course. If you want to become a subject matter expert in your creative area, connect with leading researchers and access unique professional development opportunities, you might like to progress into a <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/research" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Higher Degree by Research</a>.</p> </div><a class="sup uppercase" href="#" style="display: block; margin-top: 10px;">Read more</a></section>',

Designed for students who have completed an undergraduate degree in a discipline other than psychology, the course introduces you to the fundamentals of psychology and human behaviour while fast-tracking your journey to becoming a registered psychologist.<br/><br/><strong>Ready for a career in psychology but don’t want to start from scratch with an undergraduate degree?</strong></p><div style="display: none; transition: max-height 0.8s, opacity 0.8s; overflow: hidden; max-height: 0px; opacity: 0;"> <p>If you are looking to move into psychology, but the idea of committing to a three-year undergraduate degree seems a bit daunting, the Graduate Diploma of Psychological Science is your perfect option. It allows you to reach your goals, faster. You will be studying the accredited psychology major sequence only, which means you can complete the degree in as little as one year (if you study full-time in trimesters 1, 2 and 3). Plus, the course can be studied on campus or online, giving you the flexibility to achieve your goals on your schedule.</p> <p>The course may be short in duration, but you will be getting a comprehensive introduction to the human mind and the fundamentals of human behaviour. In your second and third trimester you will be covering more complex topics like child development, psychopathology, neural structure and social behaviour. Course content is industry-led and delivered by passionate teachers who are active contributors to the field – just one of the reasons why postgraduate psychology courses at Deakin rank #1 in Victoria for student satisfaction and have a reputation for teaching quality.*</p> <p>Once you graduate, even more opportunities start to open up. The Graduate Diploma of Psychological Science is accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) – and is the equivalent of a three-year accredited psychology undergraduate degree – so once you graduate you can apply for an APAC-accredited ‘fourth year’ of study that allows you to seek provisional registration with the Psychology Board of Australia. Your options include:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/bachelor-psychological-science-honours">Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/graduate-diploma-psychology-advanced">Graduate Diploma of Psychology (Advanced)</a></li> </ul> <p>Following the completion of a ‘fourth year’ of study, you will then be eligible to apply for the following APAC-accredited courses that lead to general registration as a psychologist:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/master-psychology-organisational">Master of Psychology (Organisational)</a> – the only organisational psychology course in Victoria, offered on campus, full-time and part-time</li> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/master-psychology-clinical">Master of Psychology (Clinical)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/master-professional-psychology">Master of Professional Psychology</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/doctor-psychology-clinical">Doctor of Psychology (Clinical)</a>.</li> </ul> <p>If you are not interested in becoming a registered psychologist, you will graduate from this course with a deep understanding of human behaviour that allows you to solve more complex issues and build better relationships in your current role. The skills you will be learning are incredibly valuable across all fields of work and in all walks of life.</p> <p>For those looking to switch careers, your experiences throughout the course will prepare you for new challenges in a variety of areas including community welfare and case management, human resources, public health, mental health rehabilitation and social work.</p> <p><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-psychology/study-with-us/psychology-pathways-to-registration">Learn more about psychology pathways and career outcomes</a></p> </div><a class="sup uppercase" href="#" style="display: block; margin-top: 10px;">Read more</a></section>',

Designed for students who have completed an undergraduate degree in a discipline other than psychology, the course introduces you to the fundamentals of psychology and human behaviour while fast-tracking your journey to becoming a registered psychologist.<br/><br/><strong>Ready for a career in psychology but don’t want to start from scratch with an undergraduate degree?</strong></p><div style="display: none; transition: max-height 0.8s, opacity 0.8s; overflow: hidden; max-height: 0px; opacity: 0;"> <p>If you are looking to move into psychology, but the idea of committing to a three-year undergraduate degree seems a bit daunting, the Graduate Diploma of Psychological Science is your perfect option. It allows you to reach your goals, faster. You will be studying the accredited psychology major sequence only, which means you can complete the degree in as little as one year (if you study full-time in trimesters 1, 2 and 3). Plus, the course can be studied on campus or online, giving you the flexibility to achieve your goals on your schedule.</p> <p>The course may be short in duration, but you will be getting a comprehensive introduction to the human mind and the fundamentals of human behaviour. In your second and third trimester you will be covering more complex topics like child development, psychopathology, neural structure and social behaviour. Course content is industry-led and delivered by passionate teachers who are active contributors to the field – just one of the reasons why postgraduate psychology courses at Deakin rank #1 in Victoria for student satisfaction and have a reputation for teaching quality.*</p> <p>Once you graduate, even more opportunities start to open up. The Graduate Diploma of Psychological Science is accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) – and is the equivalent of a three-year accredited psychology undergraduate degree – so once you graduate you can apply for an APAC-accredited ‘fourth year’ of study that allows you to seek provisional registration with the Psychology Board of Australia. Your options include:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/bachelor-psychological-science-honours">Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/graduate-diploma-psychology-advanced">Graduate Diploma of Psychology (Advanced)</a></li> </ul> <p>Following the completion of a ‘fourth year’ of study, you will then be eligible to apply for the following APAC-accredited courses that lead to general registration as a psychologist:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/master-psychology-organisational">Master of Psychology (Organisational)</a> – the only organisational psychology course in Victoria, offered on campus, full-time and part-time</li> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/master-psychology-clinical">Master of Psychology (Clinical)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/master-professional-psychology">Master of Professional Psychology</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/doctor-psychology-clinical">Doctor of Psychology (Clinical)</a>.</li> </ul> <p>If you are not interested in becoming a registered psychologist, you will graduate from this course with a deep understanding of human behaviour that allows you to solve more complex issues and build better relationships in your current role. The skills you will be learning are incredibly valuable across all fields of work and in all walks of life.</p> <p>For those looking to switch careers, your experiences throughout the course will prepare you for new challenges in a variety of areas including community welfare and case management, human resources, public health, mental health rehabilitation and social work.</p> <p><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-psychology/study-with-us/psychology-pathways-to-registration">Learn more about psychology pathways and career outcomes</a></p> </div><a class="sup uppercase" href="#" style="display: block; margin-top: 10px;">Read more</a></section>',

The program has a primary function in providing doctors with a structured training and experience in independent research, specifically in the surgical speciality.

The common thread across our talented group of students is a deep love for reading and writing. Developing skills alongside students and teachers who share your passion is one of the highlights of this course.<br/><br/>Many students use this course as a pathway into the <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/course/master-arts-writing-and-literature" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Master of Arts (Writing and Literature)</a>. As such, it includes two core units from the Masters program.<br/><br/>The foundation units provide an introduction to the craft and conventions of creative writing, professional writing and publishing. Dive into the theory and history stemming from traditional literature and explore conceptual and practical approaches to creativity, craft, form and publication. These units challenge you to add discipline and structure to your creativity and the writing tasks you will complete simulate the same work you will be doing in your future role.<br/><br/>You’ll then choose your remaining six units from a broad list of writing, literature and elective study areas. This allows you to build specialist skills and design a degree based on your career aspirations. <br/><br/>Importantly, the course provides more than just writing expertise. The projects you work on train you in transferable skills, including critical analysis, communication, problem solving and research – incredibly valuable in every field of work. You’ll also get to debate literature, creativity and modern writing challenges with like-minded people from different corners of business and life. This exposure to new ways of thinking helps you grow as a writer and shows you how literature can be used to make sense of different aspects of culture, place and history.<br/><br/>The course provides lots of exposure to industry work, trends and opportunities, better preparing you for the current and future needs of the field. Many students take advantage of our industry partnerships to secure internships at well-known publications. <a class="link--external" href="https://verandahjournal.com.au/" target="_blank">Verandah Journal<span class="dkn-icon icon-externalLink"></span></a>, an annual student-run publication, showcases the best work of emerging writers and artists while giving students the chance to develop expertise in selecting, editing and proofreading submissions for publication.

At the same time, you will also open the door to a world of opportunity through your study in the arts.<br/><br/>Learn the perfect mix of skills sought by employers by studying one degree, with exposure to two distinct areas of interest. Combining your passions in psychology and the arts can broaden your career options and make you more employable once you graduate.<br/><br/>The added benefit of an arts degree at Deakin is the transferable skills you build through experiential learning. Learn to work in teams during industry placements, develop critical analysis through work-integrated learning, and build valuable life skills through international experiences. Combine this with in-depth study in psychology as a scientific discipline and learn about human behaviour and personality.<br/><br/><strong>Why not study psychology your way, with more flexibility and diverse opportunities?</strong></p><div style="display: none; transition: max-height 0.8s, opacity 0.8s; overflow: hidden; max-height: 0px; opacity: 0;"> <p>You will explore diverse areas of psychology including:</p> <ul> <li>behavioural and clinical neuroscience</li> <li>child and adolescent psychology</li> <li>cognitive psychology</li> <li>forensic psychology</li> <li>human social behaviour</li> </ul> <p>Our School of Psychology is one of the largest in Victoria. It has strong partnerships with industry, including collaborative activities with government agencies, public and private organisations, hospitals and other universities.</p> <p>These partnerships ensure that your degree remains relevant to industry and workforce needs. You will be in high demand by employers who want graduates that are ready to face problems with confidence.</p> <p>You will get the chance to build real-world experience by electing to undertake the Psychology at Work (Internship) unit in your final year of study. This gives you 140-hours of practical industry placement, strengthening your employment prospects. The Bachelor of Arts (Psychology) is also recognised for registration purposes by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC).</p> <p>As a student in the Bachelor of Arts (Psychology), you will also choose an area of study in the arts to build your future-focused degree, choose from disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, communication, languages, and the creative arts.</p> <p>With specialist knowledge in your chosen arts discipline, you will learn how to apply critical, creative and strategic thinking to real-world issues. You will also develop the essential skills in communication, critical thinking and problem solving that employers are looking for.</p> <p>If you are intending to become a psychologist, this course is a pathway to a fourth-year level of study (honours or graduate diploma level). After completing a fourth year of study, you will be eligible to apply for provisional registration as a psychologist. Students wishing to become fully registered psychologists can then apply to continue their study by undertaking one of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Master of Psychology (Clinical)</li> <li>Master of Psychology (Organisational)</li> <li>Master of Professional Psychology</li> <li>Doctor of Psychology (Clinical).</li> </ul> <p>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students can enrol in Deakin’s Bachelor of Arts (Psychology) through the National Indigenous Knowledges, Education, Research and Innovation (NIKERI) Institute. NIKERI offers culturally respectful, flexible, and accredited programs that combine week-long on-campus intensives with supported online learning.

This fifth-year, APAC-accredited psychology course prepares you for a final year of supervised practice that leads to general registration as a psychologist.<br/><br/><strong>If you want to elevate your understanding of human behaviour to an expert level, why not do it at a university that’s ranked #1 in Victoria for education experiences in postgraduate psychology?</strong></p><div style="display: none; transition: max-height 0.8s, opacity 0.8s; overflow: hidden; max-height: 0px; opacity: 0;"> <p>The Master of Professional Psychology is all about preparing you for the next stage of your career. If your aim is to progress to the one-year internship that leads to registration as a psychologist, you will graduate with professional practice skills that allow you to thrive in your chosen setting. If registration isn’t your goal and you’re ready to explore new, more challenging roles in the workforce right away, the specialised knowledge you will develop throughout the course set you up to make a positive impact in people’s lives from day one.</p> <p>Haven’t mapped out your path beyond graduation? This course exposes you to the many different roles, topics and challenges that exist within psychology, allowing you to sample different career options before making your choice.</p> <p>Key areas of study include:</p> <ul> <li>psychology across the lifespan</li> <li>working with diverse populations</li> <li>ethics in professional psychology</li> <li>psychological intervention strategies such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based psychotherapeutic approaches</li> <li>the application of different psychological assessment methods such as personality, intelligence and ability tests.</li> </ul> <p>All of these skills are ingrained through practical experience. Take your learning beyond textbooks to participate in demonstrations, role-play, individualised feedback and collaboration sessions that give you a chance to apply your skills to authentic scenarios. These techniques are a step up from those learned at the undergraduate level and allow you to apply more complex interventions to a broader range of psychological symptoms.</p> <p>Your studies will be enriched further by professional practicums that consist of three key activities: workshops, placement and supervision. Practicums are another opportunity to apply the principles learned in the classroom in real-life settings. Learn on your feet, build relationships and problem-solve under the guidance of established professionals.</p> <p>Combine this extensive practical experience with a strong focus on applied research to graduate as a well-rounded professional. Learn how to apply research to your decision-making, become confident at critically analysing research and discover what it takes to conduct your own.</p> <p>Entry into the Master of Professional Psychology is competitive. That’s because Deakin is ranked #4 in Victoria for psychology<sup>^</sup>, and leads all Victorian universities for education experience, learning resources and support services. If you want to join a high-achieving group of students with a shared passion for exploring the human mind and helping others, the Master of Professional Psychology is the course to take your career forward.</p> <p><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/study/find-a-course/psychology-and-mental-health/psychology-careers">Learn more about your career options in psychology.</a></p> <p>^Student Experience Survey 2017, 2018</p> </div><a class="sup uppercase" href="#" style="display: block; margin-top: 10px;">Read more</a></section>',

Your thesis might provide commentary on a classic piece of literature, or it could be an original piece of work. We’ll find you the ideal mentor based on your goals, interests and the writing you’re working on.</p> <p>The course provides lots of exposure to industry work, trends and opportunities, better preparing you for the current and future needs of the field.

Combining your passions in psychology and the arts can broaden your career options and make you more employable once you graduate.<br/><br/>The added benefit of an arts degree at Deakin is the transferable skills you build through experiential learning. Learn to work in teams during industry placements, develop critical analysis through work-integrated learning, and build valuable life skills through international experiences. Combine this with in-depth study in psychology as a scientific discipline and learn about human behaviour and personality.<br/><br/><strong>Why not study psychology your way, with more flexibility and diverse opportunities?</strong></p><div style="display: none; transition: max-height 0.8s, opacity 0.8s; overflow: hidden; max-height: 0px; opacity: 0;"> <p>You will explore diverse areas of psychology including:</p> <ul> <li>behavioural and clinical neuroscience</li> <li>child and adolescent psychology</li> <li>cognitive psychology</li> <li>forensic psychology</li> <li>human social behaviour</li> </ul> <p>Our School of Psychology is one of the largest in Victoria.

You will be in high demand by employers who want graduates that are ready to face problems with confidence.</p> <p>You will get the chance to build real-world experience by electing to undertake the Psychology at Work (Internship) unit in your final year of study. This gives you 140-hours of practical industry placement, strengthening your employment prospects. The Bachelor of Arts (Psychology) is also recognised for registration purposes by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC).</p> <p>As a student in the Bachelor of Arts (Psychology), you will also choose an area of study in the arts to build your future-focused degree, choose from disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, communication, languages, and the creative arts.</p> <p>With specialist knowledge in your chosen arts discipline, you will learn how to apply critical, creative and strategic thinking to real-world issues. You will also develop the essential skills in communication, critical thinking and problem solving that employers are looking for.</p> <p>If you are intending to become a psychologist, this course is a pathway to a fourth year level of study (honours or graduate diploma level). After completing a fourth year of study, you will be eligible to apply for provisional registration as a psychologist.

This credit is called Recognition of prior learning. All applications for Recognition of prior learning must be made initially to the Selection Officer who will advise students of the necessary procedures.</p><p> All applications are considered on merit and usually no credit will be given for subjects/courses/units completed more than seven years prior to the request.

The course has a unique focus on rural and regional medicine, Indigenous health, patient-centred communication skills and service to marginalised communities.<br/><br/>You will develop the foundational skills essential for a career in medicine and be given the opportunity to experience healthcare in multiple specialist areas; setting you up for a range of rewarding careers, from general practice to pathology, paediatrics to surgery. With the emphasis on rural and regional medicine, this course aims to satisfy the critical shortage of doctors in regional areas; ensuring our graduates are highly employable.<br/><br/><strong>Want a medical degree that enables you to enhance community health and wellbeing?</strong></p><div style="display: none; transition: max-height 0.8s, opacity 0.8s; overflow: hidden; max-height: 0px; opacity: 0;"> <p>Deakins Doctor of Medicine Program takes you beyond the classroom to work with patients and their families across western Victoria. You’ll learn how medicine is practised in regional and rural areas, while building valuable relationships with communities and clinical teams that genuinely value and welcome you once you graduate.</p> <p>The course shines a light on Indigenous health as well as helping you broaden your perspective on clinical medicine to encompass public health, legal and ethical perspectives.</p> <p>Be part of a community of learners and teachers who support each other as you grow your understanding and capabilities. Be confident in the support provided by the School of Medicine as you learn in an environment where a culture of diversity, inclusiveness, respect and social accountability is built, together.</p> <p>Start your journey with the first two years focussing on the foundations of medicine, encompassing medical sciences, clinical capabilities, public health, medical ethics and law, and Indigenous health. You will learn to solve the kinds of problems you will face in your future career in a supportive environment, while developing your confidence in foundational clinical skills, clinical reasoning and the high-level human capabilities necessary for excellent person-centred care.</p> <p>You will build on this strong foundation by acquiring real-world clinical experience through placements in a range of healthcare settings, from hospitals and general practices to community health centres. Students will spend their third and fourth years on full-time placement during the Professional Practice of Medicine phase of the course at one of our <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-medicine/study-with-us/clinical-schools">clinical schools</a>: the <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-medicine/study-with-us/clinical-schools/rural-community-clinical-school">Rural Community Clinical School</a>, <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-medicine/study-with-us/clinical-schools/ballarat-clinical-school">Ballarat</a>, <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-medicine/study-with-us/clinical-schools/warrnambool-rural-clinical-school">Warrnambool</a>, <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-medicine/study-with-us/clinical-schools/geelong-clinical-school">Geelong</a> or <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-medicine/study-with-us/clinical-schools/eastern-health-clinical-school">Eastern Health</a>.</p> <p>All of our clinical schools, in rural and metropolitan areas, offer access to experiential learning in the clinical environment and immersion in a wide range of patient care settings, including hospital and primary care. Our Rural Community Clinical School offers a more in-depth exposure to community-based care, with students being paired with a clinical mentor and afforded opportunities to contribute directly to the health and wellbeing of patients in rural area for an extended period during their training.</p> <p>Across years three and four, you will gain hands-on experience, underpinned by essential knowledge and skills. You will undertake authentic clinical tasks to prepare you for both professional practice as a doctor and the lifelong training and development required for a career in medicine. You will also undertake a pre-internship rotation that offers a first-hand taste of the day-to-day life of a graduate doctor.</p> <p>Our Doctor of Medicine program is committed to ensuring that applicants from all backgrounds who meet the requirements of entry are able to gain access to study with us. We therefore reserve up to seven domestic places for Indigenous Australian applicants applying through the <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/indigenous-entry-stream">Indigenous Entry Stream</a>, and around 30 places for applicants applying through the <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-medicine/study-with-us/rural-training-stream">Rural Training Stream</a>. These streams are designed to remove some of the barriers to entry that Indigenous or rural applicants may experience when seeking out a career in medicine. Similarly, we offer bonuses for entry in the General Stream for applicants who have experienced financial disadvantage or come from a rural background.</p> <p>We also recognise the wealth of experience that applicants with diverse study and work experiences bring into both the Doctor of Medicine program and their future professional practice. We therefore do not have any prerequisite training requirements; applicants may have completed a bachelors-level qualification in any area, from nursing to music, engineering to physiotherapy.</p> <p>Situated within the Deakin School of Medicine, The <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/school-of-medicine/the-damion-drapac-centre">Damion Drapac Centre</a> for Equity in Health Education will produce highly skilled cohorts of vocational doctors equipped to meet the needs of the communities they will serve, in particular, rural, Indigenous, marginalised or under-served community groups.</p> <p>The Damion Drapac Scholarship for Vocational Doctors supports students who are experiencing financial limitations due to personal barriers. This $15,000 per year scholarship is for students commencing the Doctor of Medicine who are from medically underserved populations and can demonstrate a genuine passion for community medicine. <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/study/fees-and-scholarships/scholarships/find-a-scholarship/damion-drapac-scholarship-for-vocational-doctors">Find out more about the scholarship here</a>.</p> </div><a class="sup uppercase" href="#" style="display: block; margin-top: 10px;">Read more</a></section>',
