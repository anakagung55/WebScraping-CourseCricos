This includes our iPads, computer software, and mobile phones, through to smart TV''s, computer games and online banking. Software engineers focus on analysing a client’s needs, designing the best software architectural solutions, and then coordinating the implementation, integration and testing of designs. Our unique coursework will help you develop your skills to be a professional accredited software engineer. You have the choice to select four elective courses from different areas of study to diversify your knowledge. Read more Software engineering is flexible and diverse. You may prefer hands-on fieldwork, or design and development. Or you might take on a leadership role managing people and projects. Software engineers play a vital role in a wide range of industries, as well as in government and commerce. They may work in mining, manufacturing, finance, defence and security, aerospace, power generation and distribution, computer games and other entertainment-related industries. Engineering is the most commonly held degree of the highest-performing Fortune 500 CEOs. The CEOs of companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla Motors are all engineers.

As new foods, trends and challenges emerge, we must continue to assess how they impact health. This specialty area of study requires people with a passion for innovative thinking. Food and beverage processing is Australia''s largest manufacturing industry. This dynamic industry offers great opportunities for food and nutrition scientists to work in different areas. Examples include product development, food regulation, nutrition, quality assurance, food safety and research. You could work with fresh or processed foods, developing new products, or analysing existing ones. Or you could work on ensuring that foods are nutritionally balanced, safe to eat, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and desirable to buy. Read more Graduates of Food Science and Human Nutrition are in high demand. The industry is rapidly growing as society becomes savvier and the thirst for transparency and nutritional information grows. Technological advances and investment in scientific research also mean there is growing use of food, diet and functional food components to treat and prevent illness and disease. Graduates can also undertake further study such as Honours or a Higher Degree by Research in Food Science. This program can also provide a pathway into Dietetics with additional study.
