Spiritual directors must be experienced persons of prayer, humility and integrity, able to listen to, be with, and guide others as they seek to deepen their relationship with God. A specialisation in spiritual direction requires the ability to undertake meta-level reflection on the discipline.</p><p>Drawing from the Ignatian spiritual tradition, the Master of Spiritual Direction provides you with the theological, spiritual, psychological and ethical frameworks, as well as practical skills necessary to undertake spiritual direction as a ministry.

You will be encouraged to build on your existing knowledge and experience, gaining a sound understanding of social work values and practice approaches. The course emphasises social justice, human rights, and achieving the best possible outcomes for the most marginalised and disadvantaged members of our community. You will be taught by leading social work practitioners and academics, with a strong focus on experiential learning.</p><p><strong>The program is offered face-to-face and online</strong>.</p><p>You can <strong>study face-to-face</strong> at our Canberra and Sydney (Strathfield) campuses with a February intake. Or you can <strong>study online</strong> via <a href="https://online.acu.edu.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ACUOnline</a> with 140 hours (20 days) face-to-face classroom-based learning, focused on the development of professional practice skills. These are delivered on-campus as intensive programs at ACU''s Melbourne campus*. </p><p><em>*Where student numbers and demand require, the intensive classes may also be delivered at another ACU campus.</em></p><p>Field education is a core element of the face-to-face and online program, and a major part of a student’s professional identity development.

The course includes a total of 1,000 hours of supervised field education and training and ACU will match you to your placements based on where you are geographically located.</p><p>If you''re thinking of studying social work but the cost of placements is putting you off, think again!

    course_description = '<p>As a nutritionist you will create opportunities for people to learn about food and nutrition, design food products to support a healthy diet, influence food systems to foster sustainability, and advocate for a safe and equitable food supply across the globe. You will understand the science behind food and nutrition including human physiology and biochemistry, and food and culinary nutrition science. The focus on the role of food and nutrition in health promotion and disease prevention for individuals, communities and populations, particularly in at-risk groups, will prepare you for work in the emerging areas of the industry.</p><p>In today’s fast-paced and challenging world, understanding human behaviour is a vital skill. The Bachelor of Psychological Science will help you understand human functioning in a broad range of professional settings. You will graduate from the degree having completed a sequence in psychology accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) as a Level 1 Program. This sequence will ensure graduates acquire an advanced understanding of human behaviour and mental processes, and develop employable skills that are highly regarded by industry leaders. The degree also helps you prepare for optional further postgraduate study which may lead to registration as a professional psychologist. You will be equipped to make meaningful contributions toward improving the outcomes of clients, customers, colleagues and collaborators in a diverse range of settings including, but not limited to: government departments, private sector, schools, business, and not-for-profit organisations.</p><p>Combining the Bachelor of Psychological Science and the Bachelor of Nutrition Science allows for greater insights into both disciplines and, thus, benefits the graduates of the course. For instance, knowledge gained from the Bachelor of Nutrition Science can be applied by clinical psychologists working with eating disordered populations for better treatment outcomes. Further, health psychologists working with chronically ill populations, such as with people with heart disease or Type 2 diabetes, will benefit from knowledge in the area of nutrition science. Nutritionists will benefit from the knowledge gained from a Bachelor of Psychological Science which covers the motivations for eating behaviours, how habits are formed, ways to increase behavioural change, and empathetic and culturally appropriate communication skills. In recent years, there has been a shift in the practice of many nutrition professionals in the area of cardiovascular disease risk factor management, and more specifically overweight and obesity. The focus has shifted away from a reductionist approach to incorporate more holistic strategies to assist clients to change their lives, including their eating behaviours, through the use of mindfulness, and body-acceptance and inclusivity, breaking down diet culture and using non-diet approaches with more successful outcomes. In addition to the professional practice of nutritionists/dietitians and psychologists, research on eating behaviours and approaches to change eating behaviour will only be enriched when researchers come to such topics with an understanding of both disciplines. There is the potential for graduates of this double degree to make a real impact on the lives of individuals, groups and communities through interventions that result in positive changes to health.</p><p>In collaboration with the team from Refraction media, we have created a number of Job Kits to give you an insight into various professions. We hope that these will inform and inspire you to choose the career path that is right for you.
