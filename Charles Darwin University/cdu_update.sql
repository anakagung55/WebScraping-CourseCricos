You will build theoretical foundations in applied linguistics for developing knowledge and awareness in the field that targets developments in practice and research. The focus of the program is on contextualised evaluation of language, which can be applied to theoretical analysis or contribute to the continuing professional development of linguists, language teachers, TESOL practitioners, and education policy makers. You will explore content incorporating aspects that can be applied to local, regional and global contexts, and offer directed engagement with First Nations, Australian, Asian and global content and perspectives.</p><p>Study opportunities exist on-campus or online, in full-time or part-time study modes. You may personalise your course by completing a capstone research project in an area of interest that is complemented by additional coursework electives. Areas of focus across the course include Indigenous languages, linguistic analysis and documentation, language teaching and testing, and sociolinguistics. All areas are represented in coursework components, and in pursuing a capstone research project, you will have access to an expert research supervisor, who will guide you in the research journey. </p></div><p><br/><br/></p><div class=\"show-more__action\"><button class=\"button button--primary-reverse button--icon button--right icon--chevron-down\" role=\"none\">Show more</button></div></div><details class=\"accordion accordion--divided\" data-once=\"webform-details-save\" data-student-type=\"both\"><summary class=\"accordion__toggle\" data-once=\"webform-details-summary-save\" id=\"accordion-career-opportunities\"><p style="font-weight: bold;"> Career opportunities </p><span class=\"button button--small button--icon-only\"></span></summary><div class=\"accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained\"><p>Graduating from this course may lead to career opportunities in fields concerned with applied linguistics, language education, policy making, and professional domains where language, its use and role are a priority. </p><p>Graduates may also be provided with pathways for further study at the PhD level through research preparation.</p></div></details><details class=\"accordion accordion--divided\" data-once=\"webform-details-save\" data-student-type=\"domestic\"><summary class=\"accordion__toggle\" data-once=\"webform-details-summary-save\" id=\"accordion-credit-transfers-and-advanced-standing\"><p style="font-weight: bold;"> Credit transfers and advanced standing </p><span class=\"button button--small button--icon-only\"></span></summary><div class=\"accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained\"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Pathways</p><p><span><br/><strong>Pathways for Higher Education to Higher Education</strong></span></p><p>For information about credit transfer available to students with complete or incomplete study at this or other Institutions refer to <a href=\"http://www.cdu.edu.au/current-students/credit-transfer-pathways\" target=\"_blank\">Pathways for Higher Education to Higher Education</a></p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Credit transfer</p><p>For further information on credit transfer and how to apply visit <a href=\"http://ask.cdu.edu.au/app/answers/list/kw/credit%20transfer/p/0\" target=\"_blank\">ASK CDU</a></p></div></details><details class=\"accordion accordion--divided\" data-once=\"webform-details-save\" data-student-type=\"international\"><summary class=\"accordion__toggle\" data-once=\"webform-details-summary-save\" id=\"accordion-credit-transfers-and-advanced-standing--2\"><p style="font-weight: bold;"> Credit transfers and advanced standing </p><span class=\"button button--small button--icon-only\"></span></summary><div class=\"accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained\"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Credit transfer</p><p>For further information on credit transfer and how to apply visit <a href=\"http://ask.cdu.edu.au/app/answers/list/kw/credit%20transfer/p/0\" target=\"_blank\">ASK CDU</a></p></div></details><details class=\"accordion accordion--divided\" data-once=\"webform-details-save\" data-student-type=\"both\"><summary class=\"accordion__toggle\" data-once=\"webform-details-summary-save\" id=\"accordion-fees\"><p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fees </p><span class=\"button button--small button--icon-only\"></span></summary><div class=\"accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained\"><div data-student-type=\"domestic\"><p>Both Commonwealth supported (CS) and full fee (FF) places are available for this course.

Upon graduating, you will be eligible to apply for admission to the legal practice anywhere in Australia.</p><p>The Bachelor of Laws (Graduate Entry) teaches you about legal systems and principles in Australia and abroad. You will gain skills in legal research, analysis and communication, and learn theoretical perspectives on the law. The course also has a unique focus on transnational law (which looks at how laws are applied in more than one jurisdiction) and comparative law (which examines different legal systems from around the world), so you will gain insight into the legal issues facing today"s globalised economies and societies. There is a focus on the analysis, interpretation, evaluation and application of various sources of legal authority to construct solutions to legal problems. The course provides theoretical perspectives on the law and encourages an appreciation of legal issues of special significance to the Northern Territory, including Aboriginal legal issues.</p><p>If you choose to study law online, you will have 24/7 access to CDU"s online learning platform, recorded lectures and tutorial assistance. You can study where, when and how it suits you.</p><p>As the Bachelor of Laws (Graduate Entry) is a competitive course, you"re also encouraged to apply for the Associate Degree of Legal Studies or the Diploma of Laws.

During the course, you will develop your critical thinking and clinical reasoning skills, which are essential in your registered nurse role.

If you experience challenges in meeting these requirements, you are encouraged to discuss these with the University before enrolling in the course.</p><p><strong>Reporting

This degree is an accredited program of study recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia.</p><p>At CDU, you can study a Master of Nursing Practice (Pre-Registration) online or on campus, part-time or full-time. During the course, you will learn critical thinking, to apply sound clinical reasoning, to undertake comprehensive health assessments and how to practice person-centred care. The focus is on care that is evidence-based and respectful of the diverse contexts, cultures and communities where people live, connect and experience health, well-being, illness and disability.</p><p><strong>Practical training</strong></p><p>In order to complete the Master of Nursing Practice (Pre-Registration) and qualify as a Registered Nurse, you are required to undertake two types of practical experience: simulation blocks and supervised placements. </p><p>You will complete three simulation blocks (96 hours) during your study that must be completed full-time at the Sydney (NSW), Darwin (NT) or Brisbane (QLD) simulation sites. To meet the requirements of a Registered Nurse (Division 1), you will complete at least 800 hours of supervised clinical placements across the two years of the course in a variety of health care settings in your state/territory of residency. Regardless of your study mode or pattern, you are required to complete clinical placement on a full-time basis, with rotating shifts across a seven-day week. These may include night, weekend and public holiday shifts.</p><p>Reasonable travel within the nursing course is an expectation. Travel time and distance can include up to 2 hours one-way for metropolitan or rural areas. Where possible, your PEP is sourced within 150 kilometres radius of where you are currently living.</p><p><strong>English Language Requirements</strong></p><p>In order to register as a nurse or midwife in Australia, you are required to meet the English language requirements laid out by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia. This applies to all initial registrations, regardless of whether they qualified in Australia or overseas. Find out more: the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) at www.nursingmidwiferyboard.gov.au/. Applicants are required to meet the registration body English Language requirements.</p><p><strong>Safe Practice</strong></p><p>In order to study nursing and practice safely, you will need to have an inherent set of qualities. Nursing needs a degree of physical strength and mobility, endurance, communication and cognitive abilities. If you feel you may experience challenges in meeting these requirements, you are encouraged discuss these with the University before enrolling in the course.</p><p><strong>Reporting obligations</strong></p><p>Under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, CDU is required to register nursing students with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and to notify AHPRA if a student has or develops a health impairment that may place the public at substantial risk of harm.

Together these contribute to a developmental trajectory of practical learning and practice education experiences across the course, including approximately 640 placement hours. Residential school and placement experiences support students to develop the skills, knowledge, attributes, and competencies required to reach readiness to enter the profession of speech pathology.</p><p>In the first year of the program students are required to attend five consecutive days of residential school each semester. In second year, students attend two consecutive five-day residential schools (10-days total), and a practice education placement (20 days). Students will go on to complete two community-based practice education placements (a total of 60 days) in their final semester of study. Students with a part time study plan should discuss how these requirements fit into their program of study.</p><p>Students are required to self-fund attendance at residential schools and practice education placements, including covering any costs associated with travel and accommodation. Reasonable travel for community-based practice education placements is an expectation within the speech pathology course. Options to apply for funding to assist with covering these costs are available through CDU Scholarships and Faculty of Health Placements Central. First Nations students are able to access the away from base funding through CDU if their attendance at the residential school or placement meets the eligibility requirements. </p></div></details><details class=\"accordion accordion--divided\" data-once=\"webform-details-save\" data-student-type=\"both\"><summary class=\"accordion__toggle\" data-once=\"webform-details-summary-save\" id=\"accordion-professional-recognition\"><p style="font-weight: bold;"> Professional recognition </p><span class=\"button button--small button--icon-only\"></span></summary><div class=\"accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained\"><p>The Master of Speech and Language Therapy is accredited by Speech Pathology Australia.

Together these contribute to a developmental trajectory of practical learning and practice education experiences across the course, including approximately 640 placement hours. Residential school and placement experiences support students to develop the skills, knowledge, attributes, and competencies required to reach readiness to enter the profession of speech pathology.</p><p>In the first year of the program students are required to attend five consecutive days of residential school each semester. In second year, students attend two consecutive five-day residential schools (10-days total), and a practice education placement (20 days). Students will go on to complete two community-based practice education placements (a total of 60 days) in their final semester of study. Students with a part-time study plan should discuss how these requirements fit into their program of study. Students should be aware that practice education placements may be scheduled throughout the year and may not be confined to semester dates. Practice education placement dates are based on the availability of external host organisations. </p><p>Students are required to self-fund attendance at residential schools and practice education placements, including covering any costs associated with travel and accommodation. Reasonable travel for community-based practice education placements is an expectation within the speech pathology course. This may include travel or relocation for 5-8 weeks for one placement block in a regional or remote location. Options to apply for funding to assist with covering these costs are available through CDU Scholarship and Faculty of Health Placements Central. First Nations students are able to access the away from base funding through CDU if their attendance at the residential school or placement meets the eligibility requirements.</p></div></details><details class=\"accordion accordion--divided\" data-once=\"webform-details-save\" data-student-type=\"both\"><summary class=\"accordion__toggle\" data-once=\"webform-details-summary-save\" id=\"accordion-professional-recognition\"><p style="font-weight: bold;"> Professional recognition </p><span class=\"button button--small button--icon-only\"></span></summary><div class=\"accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained\"><p>The Master of Speech Pathology is accredited by Speech Pathology Australia.
