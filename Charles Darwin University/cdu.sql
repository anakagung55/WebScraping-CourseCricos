Students enrolled in the accounting degree can graduate with two qualifications including a Bachelor of Accounting and Diploma of Laws in a three year period when studying full-time. The Bachelor of Accounting includes financial accounting, management accounting, taxation, business law and finance. This vocationally oriented and student-centred course provides students with employment and professional skills needed in a rapidly changing business environment. It allows for flexibility of study and prepares students for careers in a variety of business fields. This course also develops communication, presentation and problem solving skills. Successful completion of the degree will satisfy the entry requirements of the professional accounting bodies in Australia.</p><p>The Diploma of Laws is designed to give you an understanding of aspects of law without committing to a full law degree. You will gain a broad understanding of the legal system, legal processes and some areas of the law. Select from a wide range of law elective units for both a general understanding of the law and legal principles, and some specialised knowledge.

Or, you could run your own business, work in a small local accounting firm, or work in other areas of business management.

There is a focus on the analysis, interpretation, evaluation and application of various sources of legal authority to construct solutions to legal problems. The course provides theoretical perspectives on the law and encourages an appreciation of legal issues of special significance to the Northern Territory, including Aboriginal legal issues.</p><p>If you choose to study law online, you will have 24/7 access to CDU''s online learning platform, recorded lectures and tutorial assistance.

On graduating, you will be eligible to apply for admission to the legal practice anywhere in Australia.</p><p>The Bachelor of Laws teaches you about legal systems and principles in Australia and abroad. You''ll gain skills in legal research, analysis and communication, and learn theoretical perspectives on the law. The course also has a unique focus on transnational law (which looks at how laws are applied in more than one jurisdiction) and comparative law (which examines different legal systems from around the world), so you''ll gain insight into the legal issues facing today''s globalised economies and societies.</p><p>If you choose to study law online, you''ll have 24/7 access to CDU''s online learning platform, recorded lectures and tutorial assistance. You can study where, when and how it suits you.</p><p>As the Bachelor of Laws is a competitive course, you''re also encouraged to apply for the Associate Degree of Legal Studies or the Diploma of Laws.

There is a focus on the analysis, interpretation, evaluation and application of various sources of legal authority to construct solutions to legal problems. The course also deals with theoretical perspectives on the law and encourages an appreciation of legal issues of special significance to the Northern Territory, including Aboriginal legal issues.</p><p>If you choose to study law online, you''ll have 24/7 access to CDU''s online learning platform, recorded lectures and tutorial assistance.

It is recognised as an approved program of study by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia. At CDU you can study a Bachelor of Midwifery online with intensive weeks (clinical teaching blocks) or on campus, full-time or part-time, as you learn from experts in the field.</p><p>As a graduate of the Bachelor of Midwifery, you will be ready to provide woman-centred, evidence-based care for women, babies and families throughout the childbearing journey in a variety of settings, with a particular focus on rural, remote and First Nations Australians. You will help to promote the health and wellbeing of women and their families by supporting the woman''s childbearing choices and providing expertise around pregnancy, birth, postnatal and the newborn periods. You will also be prepared to collaborate with other health professionals to continue midwifery care in complex situations.</p><p>At CDU we provide high-quality skills training that meets industry standards. We are dedicated to preparing and giving you the confidence to succeed in the real world. This course has compulsory attendance to multiple simulation teaching blocks facilitated at Darwin, Alice Springs and Sydney campuses.</p><p>Students are also required to undertake a professional experience placement each semester, varying in length from 3 to 6 weeks. Travel and associated costs are to be covered by you. Information will be given on a number of scholarships that students can apply for to support them with these costs. We are committed to sourcing placements in as many regions as possible throughout the country. However, some students may be expected to travel for their professional experience placement if we cannot source one near their home. By applying for this course, you confirm that you understand if CDU is unable to provide professional experience placements local to your home address you may need to travel for placement if you choose to apply.</p><p>As a midwifery student, you will have access to extensive technical and academic support, an easy-to-use online learning platform, and a network of nearly 400 midwifery students situated right across Australia. You will enjoy some flexibility of fitting studying around your family and work commitments and will need to be disciplined and committed in making time for study.</p><p><strong>Practical placements</strong></p><p>In order to complete the Bachelor of Midwifery, you are required to undertake professional experience placement. This provides you with invaluable practical experience and the readiness for midwifery practice.</p><p>Continuity of care is a core element of the course so a commitment to out-of-hours and between semester clinical work is required. Students must follow 10 -15 women across the duration of the degree, seeing these women four times antenatally, being on call for birth, and seeing them twice postnatally. These requirements are in addition to placement. These experiences must be done in your local community due to the many months of a woman-s journey. It also requires access to your local hospitals who may or may not support you to visit their facilities.</p><p>It is important to be aware that:</p><p>- In order to progress in the course, you are required to attend placements.</p><p>- All placements are arranged by CDU.</p><p>- Placements are subject to availability at healthcare facilities.</p><p>- Placements may include morning, evening, night, weekend and public holiday shifts. They may be scheduled shifts or on-call shifts.</p><p>- Non-attendance at placement may only occur in extenuating circumstances which, for the purpose of placements, do not include childcare and work commitments.</p><p><strong>Compulsory attendance</strong></p><p>This course has compulsory simulation teaching block attendance for one week each semester, facilitated at Darwin, Alice Springs or Sydney campuses. Students are also required to undertake a professional experience placement each semester, varying in length from 3 to 6 weeks. Travel and associated costs are to be covered by students themselves. Wherever possible, students are placed according to their residential address. However this is subject to availability of placements and not guaranteed. Depending on location, students may have to travel (including interstate) for their professional experience placements.</p><p><strong>Safe practice</strong></p><p>To study a Bachelor of Midwifery, you will need to have an inherent set of requirements. These are the essential abilities, knowledge and skills needed to achieve course learning outcomes and to be able to safely practice as a midwife.</p><p>Potential applicants are advised that midwifery is a profession which places considerable physical and psychological demands on the individual however the rewards of the profession can be profound.</p><p><strong>Reporting obligations</strong></p><p>Under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, CDU is required to register midwifery students with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and to notify AHPRA if a student has or develops a health impairment that may place the public at substantial risk of harm. Students have obligations under the National Law and are expected to understand their obligations prior to enrolling. More information on Student Registration is available on the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia website.</p><p><strong>Places are limited</strong></p><p>The Bachelor of Midwifery is a quota course, which means CDU receives more applications than there are places available. In assessing applicants, CDU will prioritise eligible applicants residing in the NT. Remaining eligible applicants will be ranked in order of academic merit. Offers will be ranked and made in order of academic merit.</p><p>If you currently reside in the Northern Territory and have done so for a minimum of 12 months; or if you identify as an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander you will compete in separate subquotas.</p><p>If you are not eligible to be considered for the above subquotas, you are still encouraged to apply, noting that it is a competitive course requiring high academic achievement in order to receive an offer.</p><p>Graduates will be eligible to apply for registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) to practice as a midwife in all Australian States or Territories.</p><p>Further course information is available on the Institution course website</p><p><strong>Essential Admission Requirements:</strong></p><p>Midwifery students must meet a specific level of English language proficiency before they start in a course.</p><p>You can show English language proficiency by:</p><p>- completing a declaration that English is your primary language, or</p><p>- sitting an English language proficiency test.</p><p>See further information www.satac.edu.au/information-for-nursing-and-midwifery-applicants</p><p><strong>Pre-clinical requirements:</strong></p><p>You must provide proof that you have met all university and State/Territory pre-clinical requirements before starting clinical placements. These requirements include, but are not limited to:</p><p>- immunisation requirements</p><p>- Senior First Aid qualification</p><p>- annual criminal record checks</p><p>- working with children clearances</p><p>- fitness-to-practice requirements.</p><p>Potential applicants are advised that midwifery is a profession which places considerable physical and psychological demands on the individual however the rewards of the profession can be profound.</p><p><br/><br/></p><div class="show-more__action"></div></div><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-career-opportunities"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Career opportunities </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><p>Graduating from this course may lead to career opportunities in roles including midwifery group practice, homebirth and working in public or private hospitals.</p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-practical-experience"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Practical experience </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><p>This course includes 1120 hours of professional experience placement plus Continuity of Midwifery Care Experiences (COMCE). </p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-professional-recognition"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Professional recognition </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><p>Graduates will be eligible to apply for registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) to practice as a midwife in all Australian States or Territories.</p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="domestic"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-credit-transfers-and-advanced-standing"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Credit transfers and advanced standing </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><h4>Pathways</h4><p><strong>Pathways for VET to Higher Education</strong><br/>Credit transfer arrangements are available to students commencing a bachelor degree at Charles Darwin University with completed Certificate IV, Diploma, Advanced Diploma or Associate Degree qualifications in the same field or discipline, subject to meeting criteria.

It is recognised as an approved program of study by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia. At CDU you can study a Bachelor of Midwifery online with intensive weeks (clinical teaching blocks) or on campus, full-time or part-time, as you learn from experts in the field.</p><p>As a graduate of the Bachelor of Midwifery, you will be ready to provide woman-centred, evidence-based care for women, babies and families throughout the childbearing journey in a variety of settings, with a particular focus on rural, remote and First Nations Australians. You will help to promote the health and wellbeing of women and their families by supporting the woman''s childbearing choices and providing expertise around pregnancy, birth, postnatal and the newborn periods. You will also be prepared to collaborate with other health professionals to continue midwifery care in complex situations.</p><p>At CDU we provide high-quality skills training that meets industry standards. We are dedicated to preparing and giving you the confidence to succeed in the real world. This course has compulsory attendance to multiple simulation teaching blocks facilitated at Darwin, Alice Springs and Sydney campuses.</p><p>Students are also required to undertake a professional experience placement each semester, varying in length from 3 to 6 weeks. Travel and associated costs are to be covered by you. Information will be given on a number of scholarships that students can apply for to support them with these costs. We are committed to sourcing placements in as many regions as possible throughout the country. However, some students may be expected to travel for their professional experience placement if we cannot source one near their home. By applying for this course, you confirm that you understand if CDU is unable to provide professional experience placements local to your home address you may need to travel for placement if you choose to apply.</p><p>As a midwifery student, you will have access to extensive technical and academic support, an easy-to-use online learning platform, and a network of nearly 400 midwifery students situated right across Australia. You will enjoy some flexibility of fitting studying around your family and work commitments and will need to be disciplined and committed in making time for study.</p><p><strong>Practical placements</strong></p><p>In order to complete the Bachelor of Midwifery, you are required to undertake professional experience placement. This provides you with invaluable practical experience and the readiness for midwifery practice.</p><p>Continuity of care is a core element of the course so a commitment to out-of-hours and between semester clinical work is required. Students must follow 10 -15 women across the duration of the degree, seeing these women four times antenatally, being on call for birth, and seeing them twice postnatally. These requirements are in addition to placement. These experiences must be done in your local community due to the many months of a woman''s journey. It also requires access to your local hospitals who may or may not support you to visit their facilities.</p><p>It is important to be aware that:</p><p>* In order to progress in the course, you are required to attend placements.</p><p>* All placements are arranged by CDU.</p><p>* Placements are subject to availability at healthcare facilities.</p><p>* Placements may include morning, evening, night, weekend and public holiday shifts. They may be scheduled shifts or on-call shifts.</p><p>* Non-attendance at placement may only occur in extenuating circumstances which, for the purpose of placements, do not include childcare and work commitments.</p><p><strong>Compulsory attendance</strong></p><p>This course has compulsory simulation teaching block attendance for one week each semester, facilitated at Darwin, Alice Springs or Sydney campuses. Students are also required to undertake a professional experience placement each semester, varying in length from 3 to 6 weeks. Travel and associated costs are to be covered by students themselves. Wherever possible, students are placed according to their residential address. However this is subject to availability of placements and not guaranteed. Depending on location, students may have to travel (including interstate) for their professional experience placements.</p><p><strong>Safe practice</strong></p><p>To study a Bachelor of Midwifery, you will need to have an inherent set of requirements. These are the essential abilities, knowledge and skills needed to achieve course learning outcomes and to be able to safely practice as a midwife.</p><p>Potential applicants are advised that midwifery is a profession which places considerable physical and psychological demands on the individual however the rewards of the profession can be profound.</p><p><strong>Reporting obligations</strong></p><p>Under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, CDU is required to register midwifery students with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and to notify AHPRA if a student has or develops a health impairment that may place the public at substantial risk of harm. Students have obligations under the National Law and are expected to understand their obligations prior to enrolling. More information on Student Registration is available on the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia website.</p><p><strong>Places are limited</strong></p><p>The Bachelor of Midwifery is a quota course, which means CDU receives more applications than there are places available. In assessing applicants, CDU will prioritise eligible applicants residing in the NT. Remaining eligible applicants will be ranked in order of academic merit. Offers will be ranked and made in order of academic merit.</p><p>If you currently reside in the Northern Territory and have done so for a minimum of 12 months; or if you identify as an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander you will compete in separate subquotas.</p><p>If you are not eligible to be considered for the above subquotas, you are still encouraged to apply, noting that it is a competitive course requiring high academic achievement in order to receive an offer.</p><p>Graduates will be eligible to apply for registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) to practice as a midwife in all Australian States or Territories.</p><p>Applicants with current Division 1 AHPRA registration as a registered nurse, should apply for the <a href="https://www.cdu.edu.au/study/course/graduate-diploma-midwifery-tmidw1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Graduate Diploma of Midwifery</a>.</p><p>Further course information is available on the Institution course website</p><p><strong>Essential Admission Requirements:</strong></p><p>Midwifery students must meet a specific level of English language proficiency before they start in a course.</p><p>You can show English language proficiency by:</p><p>* completing a declaration that English is your primary language, or</p><p>* sitting an English language proficiency test.</p><p>See further information www.satac.edu.au/information-for-nursing-and-midwifery-applicants</p><p><strong>Pre-clinical requirements:</strong></p><p>You must provide proof that you have met all university and State/Territory pre-clinical requirements before starting clinical placements.

During the course, you will develop your critical thinking and clinical reasoning skills, which are essential in your registered nurse role. The focus is on evidence-based nursing care and respect for the diverse contexts, cultures and communities where people live, connect and experience health, well-being, illness and disability.</p><p><strong>Practical training</strong></p><p>To complete the Master of Nursing Practice (Pre-Registration) and qualify as a Registered Nurse, you must undertake two types of practical experience: simulation blocks and supervised placements. </p><p>You will complete three simulation blocks (96 hours) during your study, which you will complete full-time at the Sydney (NSW), Darwin (NT), or Brisbane (QLD) (external students only) simulation sites. To meet the requirements of a Registered Nurse (Division 1), you will complete at least 800 hours of supervised clinical placements across the two years of the course in various healthcare settings in your state/territory of residency. Regardless of your study mode or pattern, you must complete clinical placement full-time, with rotating shifts across a seven-day week. These may include night, weekend and public holiday shifts. Students are responsible for the cost of clinical placement and simulation block attendance (including travel and accommodation).</p><p>Reasonable travel to attend placements is an expectation. Travel time and distance can include up to 2 hours one-way for metropolitan or rural areas. Your placement is sourced within a 150-kilometre radius of where you live.</p><p><strong>English Language Requirements</strong></p><p>To register as a nurse in Australia, you must meet the English language requirements of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia. This requirement applies to all initial registrations, regardless of whether they qualified in Australia or overseas. Learn more about the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) at www.nursingmidwiferyboard.gov.au/.</p><p><strong>Safe Practice - Inherent Requirements</strong></p><p>To study nursing and practice safely, you must have an inherent set of qualities. Nursing requires a degree of physical strength and mobility, endurance, communication, and cognitive abilities. If you experience challenges in meeting these requirements, you are encouraged to discuss these with the University before enrolling in the course.</p><p><strong>Reporting obligations</strong></p><p>Under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, CDU must register nursing students with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and notify AHPRA if a student has or develops a health impairment that may place the public at substantial risk of harm--more information from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) at <a href="http://www.nursingmidwiferyboard.gov.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.nursingmidwiferyboard.gov.au/</a>.</p><p><br/><br/></p><div class="show-more__action"></div></div><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-career-opportunities"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Career opportunities </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><p>Graduating from this course may lead to career opportunities in public and private health settings and specialty areas such as mental health, community health, acute and chronic care.</p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-practical-experience"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Practical experience </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><p>This course includes a minimum of 800 hours clinical placement.</p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-professional-recognition"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Professional recognition </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><p>Graduates of the Master of Nursing (pre-registration) are eligible to apply for registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (<a href="http://www.nursingmidwiferyboard.gov.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia</a>).</p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="domestic"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-credit-transfers-and-advanced-standing"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Credit transfers and advanced standing </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><h4>Pathways</h4><p><span><br/><strong>Pathways for Higher Education to Higher Education</strong></span></p><p>For information about credit transfer available to students with complete or incomplete study at this or other Institutions refer to <a href="http://www.cdu.edu.au/current-students/credit-transfer-pathways" target="_blank">Pathways for Higher Education to Higher Education</a></p><h4>Credit transfer</h4><p>For further information on credit transfer and how to apply visit <a href="http://ask.cdu.edu.au/app/answers/list/kw/credit%20transfer/p/0" target="_blank">ASK CDU</a></p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="international"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-credit-transfers-and-advanced-standing--2"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Credit transfers and advanced standing </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><h4>Credit transfer</h4><p>For further information on credit transfer and how to apply visit <a href="http://ask.cdu.edu.au/app/answers/list/kw/credit%20transfer/p/0" target="_blank">ASK CDU</a></p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-fees"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Fees </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><div data-student-type="domestic"><h4>Commonwealth supported places</h4><p>Commonwealth Supported places are available in this course to students who meet one of the following residency requirements:<br/><br/> (a) be an Australian citizen, who will complete some of your course of study while resident in Australia;

This degree is an accredited program of study recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia.</p><p>At CDU, you can study a Master of Nursing Practice (Pre-Registration) online or on campus, part-time or full-time. During the course, you will learn critical thinking, to apply sound clinical reasoning, to undertake comprehensive health assessments and how to practice person-centred care. The focus is on care that is evidence-based and respectful of the diverse contexts, cultures and communities where people live, connect and experience health, well-being, illness and disability.</p><p><strong>Practical training</strong></p><p>In order to complete the Master of Nursing Practice (Pre-Registration) and qualify as a Registered Nurse, you are required to undertake two types of practical experience: simulation blocks and supervised placements. </p><p>You will complete three simulation blocks (96 hours) during your study that must be completed full-time at the Sydney (NSW), Darwin (NT) or Brisbane (QLD) simulation sites. To meet the requirements of a Registered Nurse (Division 1), you will complete at least 800 hours of supervised clinical placements across the two years of the course in a variety of health care settings in your state/territory of residency. Regardless of your study mode or pattern, you are required to complete clinical placement on a full-time basis, with rotating shifts across a seven-day week. These may include night, weekend and public holiday shifts.</p><p>Reasonable travel within the nursing course is an expectation. Travel time and distance can include up to 2 hours one-way for metropolitan or rural areas. Where possible, your PEP is sourced within 150 kilometres radius of where you are currently living.</p><p><strong>English Language Requirements</strong></p><p>In order to register as a nurse or midwife in Australia, you are required to meet the English language requirements laid out by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia. This applies to all initial registrations, regardless of whether they qualified in Australia or overseas. Find out more: the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) at www.nursingmidwiferyboard.gov.au/. Applicants are required to meet the registration body English Language requirements.</p><p><strong>Safe Practice</strong></p><p>In order to study nursing and practice safely, you will need to have an inherent set of qualities.

Together these contribute to a developmental trajectory of practical learning and practice education experiences across the course, including approximately 640 placement hours. Residential school and placement experiences support students to develop the skills, knowledge, attributes, and competencies required to reach readiness to enter the profession of speech pathology.</p><p>In the first year of the program students are required to attend five consecutive days of residential school each semester. In second year, students attend two consecutive five-day residential schools (10-days total), and a practice education placement (20 days). Students will go on to complete two community-based practice education placements (a total of 60 days) in their final semester of study. Students with a part time study plan should discuss how these requirements fit into their program of study.</p><p>Students are required to self-fund attendance at residential schools and practice education placements, including covering any costs associated with travel and accommodation. Reasonable travel for community-based practice education placements is an expectation within the speech pathology course. Options to apply for funding to assist with covering these costs are available through CDU Scholarships and Faculty of Health Placements Central. First Nations students are able to access the away from base funding through CDU if their attendance at the residential school or placement meets the eligibility requirements. </p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-professional-recognition"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Professional recognition </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><p>The Master of Speech and Language Therapy is accredited by Speech Pathology Australia.

Together these contribute to a developmental trajectory of practical learning and practice education experiences across the course, including approximately 640 placement hours. Residential school and placement experiences support students to develop the skills, knowledge, attributes, and competencies required to reach readiness to enter the profession of speech pathology.</p><p>In the first year of the program students are required to attend five consecutive days of residential school each semester. In second year, students attend two consecutive five-day residential schools (10-days total), and a practice education placement (20 days). Students will go on to complete two community-based practice education placements (a total of 60 days) in their final semester of study. Students with a part-time study plan should discuss how these requirements fit into their program of study. Students should be aware that practice education placements may be scheduled throughout the year and may not be confined to semester dates. Practice education placement dates are based on the availability of external host organisations. </p><p>Students are required to self-fund attendance at residential schools and practice education placements, including covering any costs associated with travel and accommodation. Reasonable travel for community-based practice education placements is an expectation within the speech pathology course. This may include travel or relocation for 5-8 weeks for one placement block in a regional or remote location. Options to apply for funding to assist with covering these costs are available through CDU Scholarship and Faculty of Health Placements Central. First Nations students are able to access the away from base funding through CDU if their attendance at the residential school or placement meets the eligibility requirements.</p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-professional-recognition"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Professional recognition </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><p>The Master of Speech Pathology is accredited by Speech Pathology Australia.

It also offers experienced tertiary teaching staff the opportunity to further develop their practice and to obtain formal recognition as either micro-credentials or a postgraduate qualification that can be used toward a Master''s qualification. </p><p>Through a pedagogy that promotes reflective practice, co-design, peer review and students as partners, participants in these units will be engaged in learning that can be applied to their teaching practice. Modules as microcredentials in each unit contribute to a learning and teaching e-portfolio that builds towards the Graduate Certificate, while at the same time providing clearly articulated RPL options to recognise and valorise staff commitment to excellence in T&amp;L. Additionally, the course will be aligned with the Higher Education Academy (HEA) standards to provide staff with a clear pathway towards a Fellowship.</p><p><br/><br/></p><div class="show-more__action"></div></div><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="domestic"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-credit-transfers-and-advanced-standing"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Credit transfers and advanced standing </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><h4>Pathways</h4><p><span><br/><strong>Pathways for Higher Education to Higher Education</strong></span></p><p>For information about credit transfer available to students with complete or incomplete study at this or other Institutions refer to <a href="http://www.cdu.edu.au/current-students/credit-transfer-pathways" target="_blank">Pathways for Higher Education to Higher Education</a></p><h4>Credit transfer</h4><p>For further information on credit transfer and how to apply visit <a href="http://ask.cdu.edu.au/app/answers/list/kw/credit%20transfer/p/0" target="_blank">ASK CDU</a></p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="international"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-credit-transfers-and-advanced-standing--2"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Credit transfers and advanced standing </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><h4>Credit transfer</h4><p>For further information on credit transfer and how to apply visit <a href="http://ask.cdu.edu.au/app/answers/list/kw/credit%20transfer/p/0" target="_blank">ASK CDU</a></p></div></details><details class="accordion accordion--divided" data-once="webform-details-save" data-student-type="both"><summary class="accordion__toggle" data-once="webform-details-summary-save" id="accordion-fees"><p style="font-weight:bold;"> Fees </p><span class="button button--small button--icon-only"></span></summary><div class="accordion__content rich-text rich-text--contained"><div data-student-type="domestic"><h4>Commonwealth supported places</h4><p>Commonwealth Supported places are available in this course to students who meet one of the following residency requirements:<br/><br/> (a) be an Australian citizen, who will complete some of your course of study while resident in Australia; or<br/><br/> (b) a New Zealand citizen; or an Australian permanent visa holder; or an eligible former permanent humanitarian visa holder; who studies the entire course while living in Australia.<br/><br/> Further information about fees and charges can be found at <a href="http://www.cdu.edu.au/student-central/fees-payments/domestic-fees" target="_blank">Fees and Payments</a>.</p><h4>Non-Commonwealth supported places</h4><p>Full fee paying places are available in this course.<br/><br/> Information about fees and charges can be found at <a href="http://www.cdu.edu.au/student-central/fees-payments/domestic-fees" target="_blank">Fees and Payments</a>.</p></div><div data-student-type="international"><h4>International tuition fees</h4><p>The annual tuition fee for full time study in 2026 is AUD $16,380.00.
