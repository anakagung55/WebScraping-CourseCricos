The course provides a solid base in all of the key foundational and important areas of IT, and also provides the opportunity for students to specialise and develop deep knowledge within specific areas. The BIT has been designed to meet the current and growing skill shortage in IT, particularly in the areas of computer networking and cyber security. Students have the option to undertake specific advanced elective units and graduate with a specialisation in Computer Networks and Security. The networking units within the BIT have been designed to ensure graduates have both the knowledge and skills to design and configure large scale enterprise networks.

These units also prepare students to be ready to undertake the CISCO Certificate Network Associate exam (CCNA 200-301), that forms a key part of the CISCO set of industry certifications. The cyber security units enable students to understand the latest technologies and trends in cyber defensive strategies and ensure graduates are able to design network systems that are resilient to cyber threats.',
