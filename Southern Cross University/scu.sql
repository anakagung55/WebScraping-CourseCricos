This degree will prepare you to work in these industries, and to contribute to shaping the future in Australia and globally.</p> <p> The Associate Degree of Engineering is designed to meet the requirements for accreditation at the level of Engineering Associate by Engineers Australia. The course is structured around 16 key competencies identified by Engineers Australia as being essential to the graduating engineer, which are broadly grouped into knowledge and skills, application, personal and professional skills.</p> <p> The course is suited to school leavers or those with a trade qualification who are looking to enter the civil construction or manufacturing and production industries in a supervisory, project management or technical role, or progress their careers in these industries to the next level.</p> <p> Foundational core units build knowledge of the practical and technical skills and the processes and philosophy that underpin engineering systems. You’ll then choose a specialisation to build additional knowledge and skills needed to perform technical roles in a range of engineering systems relevant to your specialisation. Finally, you''''ll complete project-based units that will develop your skills in critical thinking, creative problem solving and project management, and additionally complete a total of 30 days (240 hours) engagement with professional practice during your studies, ensuring you are ready to hit the ground running as a graduate.</p> <p> <strong>All students must complete ONE compulsory on-campus residential.

Students are encouraged to take an explicit doctrinal or theoretical position on their topic.</p> <p> It is a thorough preparation for the demands of a career in law, and the basis for a career in academia and research. It may enhance career prospects, be a pathway to a PhD or further study at the postgraduate level. Eligible graduates may be considered for a University Medal.</p> <p> Southern Cross is home to a dynamic and supportive community of legal scholars with a strong interdisciplinary focus in research. Under the supervision of a qualified legal scholar, students will undertake an extensive project and produce an original thesis which may lie in the exploration and deeper understanding of research methodologies, legal theories and legal scholarship, or in the wide gamut of legal practice from family and civil law to criminal and specialist legal practice. </p> <p> To be eligible for Honours, you must:</p> <ul> <li> Confirm you have completed an Australian Bachelor of Laws (LLB) Degree (AQF level 7) with a minimum GPA of 5.50 on 20 of the highest 12-credit point law units (or equivalent) that are credited toward the LLB degree, unless approved by the Law Honours Coordinator.</li> <li> Contact a prospective Academic Supervisor to discuss a potential research project.
