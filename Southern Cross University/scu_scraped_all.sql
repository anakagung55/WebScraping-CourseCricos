How do we control our movements and behaviour? What makes us tick? Exploration of the human mind and behaviour is a fascinating field and this degree is an equally fascinating educational journey into behaviour, cognition, and psychological principles and theory.</p> <p> We have designed our Bachelor of Psychological Science to be a rich, flexible, and highly engaging learning experience. It will shed light on how humans work, individually and in sociocultural groups, and will take you inside your own head — to develop a deep and real understanding of your own thoughts, emotions, and behaviour. It will take you across many different fields of psychological practice — many you will never have considered. You will be working with an academic team comprising active researchers publishing their work in international journals.</p> <p> This degree will help you develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as proficiency in research and statistics, all of which will inform your ability to apply scientific approaches in professional settings as well as enhance your understanding of yourself and of the world.</p> <p> Pathway option: <a href="https://www.scu.edu.au/study/courses/diploma-of-health-2125150/">Diploma of Health</a> (Psychological Science Specialisation).</p> </div>',

Graduates are equipped with both scientific knowledge and practical skills to address critical global issues.</p> <p> The three specialisations in Environment, Agriculture and Marine offer focused expertise aligned with real-world applications, allowing students to tackle environmental challenges, sustainable agricultural practices, and marine conservation.</p> <p> Graduates from the Bachelor of Science will have diverse employment opportunities across environmental, marine, and agricultural sectors, each offering local and international prospects.</p> <p> Students will choose one of the following specialisations to focus their degree (the specialisation appears on your graduating testamur):</p> <p> <strong>Environment</strong></p> <p> This specialisation focuses on understanding and managing the natural environment. Students learn about ecosystems, biodiversity, climate change and sustainability. The program equips graduates with skills in environmental analysis, resource management and conservation, preparing them for careers in environmental consulting, government agencies and non-profit organisations.</p> <p> <strong>Marine</strong></p> <p> This specialisation builds on introductory earth systems knowledge with units at our National Marine Science Centre, positioned near the Solitary Islands Marine Park. These units cover oceanography, marine ecology, fish and aquaculture, reefs, fisheries and marine parks management.</p> <p> This specialisation dives into the study of marine ecosystems, oceanography and marine conservation. Students explore the dynamic relationships between marine organisms and their environments. Graduates are well-positioned for roles in marine research and conservation, fisheries management and environmental policy.</p> <p> <strong>Agriculture</strong></p> <p> The Agriculture specialisation focuses on sustainable agricultural practices, crop science and food production systems. Students learn about soil management, plant biology and modern agricultural technology. This prepares graduates for roles in agronomy, agricultural consulting and food security sectors.</p> <p> The Bachelor of Science is characterised by practical field experience in all years, making use of our easy access to a variety of subtropical terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems.</p> <p> Online students must complete on-campus compulsory residentials for some units (please see Notes for relevant units in the Course Structure/Progression section).</p> </div>',
